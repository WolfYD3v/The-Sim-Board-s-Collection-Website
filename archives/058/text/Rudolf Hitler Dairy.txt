Dear Dairy,

it's hard to write down this story to you, really, but I think I have too.
I'm now 35, but 22 years before at my 13th, I was bullied.

I was in a badly reputated school. This kind of place with free access, and very cheap food.
It was near from a social complex, where drug traffic was at his hightess. So when a little shy boy use a path near from a "spot" well you should look at your phone. You should.
This is what I haven't done, I was to curious and… 3 of my classmates where selling some white powder. They spotted me, and then, my Hell started.

Since then, after years of bullying, I have cookies with black chocolate chips. As a proud cookie with white chocolate chips, tournmented by the darkness of the bad cookies, I had to do Something.
Not stop the traffic, but become their villain.

So I have run for office, and I've win. I have passed laws to kill all black chips cookies.
I was hated for that, so I have passed a law to forbidden hate against me. No more monifestations, no more rebelion.
It was peace.

So much peace, too much peace.
So my old bullies (I captured them and they eated shit every day) has been tortured to death, one by one…
It was awesome, their tears, their cry for help… No one escaped from my torture chamber!

But when I have discovered I could overcook them to kill them… It was fantastic…
"You're gonna take this train, alone, and then you will be free after a little ride. It's a fair deal."
How stupid and lost he was, going outside after years of captivity… To die!

How crual I am… I was so crual, I was a king!

But of course Europa, kind Europa, declared the 6th Grand World War against my land.
How? Why?
Ah yes, to stop me and free all the hostages ready to be tortured and burned too much.

Am I the villain?
Or are they…
